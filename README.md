## General Assembly SEI Project 2 (Full-stack-project)

## Planning story
The goal of this project is to build a full stack application. The idea is to have a frontend where the user would be able to create an account using the authorization forms, get into the website and create, update, delete and see all created items within their account. The user should also not be able to log into their and be able CRUD in anyone else's account.

#### Breaking down the challange
With the frontend, I started by getting the authorization forms done, that way a new user would be able to create an account and sign in before doing anything with the teams resource. When that was complete, I moved on to creating the forms that would be used to CRUD the resource that had been built
